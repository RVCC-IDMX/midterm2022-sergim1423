      <p>
        Ive been coding for around 2 years now, and from then to now I have
        learned alot and improved a ton. If you have a problem I can fix it. I
        can make any website you please, no matter how hard you think it is. If
        you have the idea, I can make it happen. If you dont believe me, have a
        look for yourself at my previous work.

        <p>
          When I brought the project to Sergi, I didnt think it was even
          possible. But Sergi assured me he can get it done. Id say the work
          speaks for itself. Im beyond words. - Customer 1

        <h2>Customer #2 review</h2>
        <p>
          Cant believe the work that he was able to do. I gave him a two week
          time table to complete the site and he deliverd. More than happy with
          the result. - Customer 2
